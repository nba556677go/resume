\subtext{\textbf{1st place, 81 teams in total} \hfill Taipei, Taiwan}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Trained \textbf{deep learning BERT} models to complete reading comprehension tasks based on medical dialogues of over 2000+ words. Utilized \textbf{BM25} to rank word cosine similarity under BERT’s input length constraints.
\item Performed \textbf{data augmentation} by including additional Chinese dialogues, improving accuracy by 20\%.
\item Implemented the \textbf{XLNet model} to assess patient risk levels, achieving 92\% accuracy.
\end{zitemize}
